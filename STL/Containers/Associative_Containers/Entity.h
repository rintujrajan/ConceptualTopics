    ************ for set/map
    If we want to store user-defined datatype in a set (eg. structure) then the compiler will show an error message.
    That is because of the property of the set/map that value kept in the set must be ascending or descending order.
    While doing so the compiler cant compare two structures(as they are user-defined) and thatâ€™s the reason why the compiler shows us the error message.
    So, in order to store a structure in a set, some comparison function needs to be designed as the one below

    ************ for unordered_set/unordered_map
    If we want to store the element of user defined type as structure then compiler will show an error. Here a hash is used to maintain hash table.
    A comparison function for equality is required because the hash cannot rely on the fact that the hash function will always provide a unique hash value for every distinct key (i.e., it needs to be able to deal with collisions),
    so it needs a way to compare two given keys for an exact match.

    The other item to be defined is a hash function, in three optional ways which are defined below
